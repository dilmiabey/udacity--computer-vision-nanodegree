## Facial Keypoint Detection
In this project, you’ll combine your knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures to build a facial keypoint detection system. Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition.
The final code written should be able to look at any image, detect faces, and predict the locations of key-points on each face

## Image Captioning
In this project, you will create a neural network architecture to automatically generate captions from images using the Microsoft Common Objects in Context(MS COCO) dataset.

## Landmark Detection and Robot Tracking(SLAM)
In this project, you'll implement SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) for a 2 dimensional world.You’ll combine what you know about robot sensor measurements and movement to create a map of an environment from only sensor and motion data gathered by a robot, over time. SLAM gives you a way to track the location of a robot in the world in real-time and identify the locations of landmarks such as buildings, trees, rocks, and other world features.
